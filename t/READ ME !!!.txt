Hello :)

So about this project , I was not aware of this form until this morning (friday) and given the little time I had I coudnt make what you asked 

exactly(car game) so I finished an old project of mine which is TETRIS , an old project that I was working on when I was learning python so I 
seized this oportunity to show you what I made .
I hope this doesnt make me look bad as you know its kinda hard staying focused on things other than studies , thank u for your understanding and I do wish that you'll like it :)
